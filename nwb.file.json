Core metadata (e.g., that required to interpret data fields) is stored with the data itself, and implicitly defined by the file specification (e.g., time is in seconds). The strategy used here for storing non-core metadata is to use free-form text fields, such as would appear in sentences or paragraphs from a Methods section. Metadata fields are text to enable them to be more general, for example to represent ranges instead of numerical values. Machine-readable metadata is stored as attributes to these free-form datasets.
